# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image to build the app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Set working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json for dependency installation
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use nginx to serve the built files
FROM nginx:alpine AS production

# Copy built files from the previous stage to nginx's default public directory
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom nginx configuration (optional)
# COPY ./nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
